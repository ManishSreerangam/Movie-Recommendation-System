# Movie-Recommendation-System
This repository is a part of my pet project, where i work to implement my understanding of collaborative filtering and "netflix movie recommendation problem" on the famous "MovieLens" dataset

# dataset
* i have taken this dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/ webpage
* i have used 2 datasets
  * a movies.csv file which holds the information of movie titles and its respective Id's
  * a rating.csv file which holds ratings provided for every movie
# similarity measure
For calcuting similarity i have used cosine similarity.

*please refer .ipynb file for more information about my implementation*
